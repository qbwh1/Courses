00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.460
Let's take a look as a packaging command we're running to pack a Spring Boot application.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.179
So let's try to use Maven Plugin to package our application.

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:22.094
So the package command actually runs a test first before generating a snapshot.

00:00:22.094 --> 00:00:25.500
Before that, we want a clean build.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.509
So we do a clean to remove the target we generate before.

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.394
We have a unit tests for our Spring Boot application here,

00:00:37.395 --> 00:00:41.410
and I'm making that fail so that you can see the process our

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:46.569
packaging if in case of unit test failure.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.579
So let's run it. Let's run the package.

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:58.879
So you can see the test is running first before we even generate the snapshot.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.750
So we run the packaging command and we have

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.409
one failure in our unit tests as you can see over here.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.924
So the snapshot is now generated because the process

00:01:13.924 --> 00:01:18.185
is stopped if there's failure in the unit test.

00:01:18.185 --> 00:01:22.600
So let's fix our unit test and try it again.

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:27.574
So again, we want to do a clean packaging.

00:01:27.575 --> 00:01:31.865
So we run a clean combat first.

00:01:31.864 --> 00:01:35.759
So let's try to package the command again.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.050
So as you can see,

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.849
the test is running and there is no failure and big success,

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:52.359
and you will see a snapshot generated for our application.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.840
That's it for the packaging.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.299
In the next video, I'm going to show you how to run the snapshot.
